    <section id="problem" class="card">
      <h3>The problem</h3>
      <p>Many educational institutions still depend on manual attendance systems, which are time-consuming and error-prone. Teachers spend a significant portion of class time marking attendance, reducing valuable instructional hours. Students often waste free periods with unproductive activities due to lack of structured guidance. This leads to poor time management and reduced alignment with long-term goals. There is also a gap in personalized learning support during idle classroom hours. Institutions currently lack tools that integrate daily schedules with individual student planning and automated tracking.</p>
